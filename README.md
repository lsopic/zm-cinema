# zm-cinema

## Start project:
After cloning, install modules: ```npm install``` <br/>
To start scripts, use: ```npm start``` </br>

### Notes:
User data is stored inside local storage, so it will load back in on refresh, unless user is missing <br/>
Since there was no button for adding movies when there are items on movie list, you can add new if you refresh while editing a movie (there is no persistence in the app)
